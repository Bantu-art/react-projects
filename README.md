# React Projects

This repository contains a collection of small React projects and components for learning and practice. Each project or component demonstrates a specific concept or feature of React, making it easy to explore and understand React development.

## Structure

- **my-first-react-app/**: Main React app where components are added and tested.
  - **src/components/**: Contains reusable React components such as `Navbar`, `Footer`, `Counter`, etc.
  
## Components

- **Navbar**: A simple navigation bar fixed at the top of the page.
- **Footer**: A footer with dummy links, always at the bottom of the page.
- **Counter**: A basic counter component using React state.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bantu-art/react-projects.git
   cd react-projects
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the main app:**
   ```bash
   cd my-first-react-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Explore components:**  
   Edit or add components in `src/components/` and import them in `App.jsx` to see them in action.

## Scripts

- **create-react-projects.py**  
  Use this script to generate multiple React project folders for experimentation:
  ```bash
  python3 create-react-projects.py
  ```
